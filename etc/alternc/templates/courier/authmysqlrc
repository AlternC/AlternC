# filesystem pipe used for the connection
#
# MYSQL_SOCKET		/var/mysql/mysql.sock

##NAME: MYSQL_PORT:0
#

# for the required fields in this table.

MYSQL_USER_TABLE	mail_users

##NAME: MYSQL_CRYPT_PWFIELD:0
#
# Either MYSQL_CRYPT_PWFIELD or MYSQL_CLEAR_PWFIELD must be defined.  Both
# are OK too. crypted passwords go into MYSQL_CRYPT_PWFIELD, cleartext
# passwords go into MYSQL_CLEAR_PWFIELD.  Cleartext passwords allow
# CRAM-MD5 authentication to be implemented.

MYSQL_CRYPT_PWFIELD	password

##NAME: MYSQL_CLEAR_PWFIELD:0
#
#
# MYSQL_CLEAR_PWFIELD	clear

##NAME: MYSQL_DEFAULT_DOMAIN:0
#
# If DEFAULT_DOMAIN is defined, and someone tries to log in as 'user',

#
# MYSQL_UID_FIELD - contains the numerical userid of the account
#
MYSQL_UID_FIELD		33

##NAME: MYSQL_GID_FIELD:0
#
# Numerical groupid of the account

MYSQL_GID_FIELD		uid

##NAME: MYSQL_LOGIN_FIELD:0
#
# The login id, default is id.  Basically the query is:
#
#  SELECT MYSQL_UID_FIELD, MYSQL_GID_FIELD, ... WHERE id='loginid'
#

MYSQL_LOGIN_FIELD	alias

##NAME: MYSQL_HOME_FIELD:0
#

MYSQL_HOME_FIELD	path

##NAME: MYSQL_NAME_FIELD:0
#
# The user's name (optional)

# MYSQL_NAME_FIELD	name

##NAME: MYSQL_MAILDIR_FIELD:0
#
# This is an optional field, and can be used to specify an arbitrary
# location of the maildir for the account, which normally defaults to
# $HOME/Maildir (where $HOME is read from MYSQL_HOME_FIELD).
#
# You still need to provide a MYSQL_HOME_FIELD, even if you uncomment this
# out.
#
# MYSQL_MAILDIR_FIELD	maildir

##NAME: MYSQL_QUOTA_FIELD:0
#
# Define MYSQL_QUOTA_FIELD to be the name of the field that can optionally
# specify a maildir quota.  See README.maildirquota for more information 
#
# MYSQL_QUOTA_FIELD	quota

##NAME: MYSQL_WHERE_CLAUSE:0
#
# This is optional, MYSQL_WHERE_CLAUSE can be basically set to an arbitrary
# fixed string that is appended to the WHERE clause of our query
#
# MYSQL_WHERE_CLAUSE	server='mailhost.example.com'

##NAME: MYSQL_SELECT_CLAUSE:0
#
# (EXPERIMENTAL)
# This is optional, MYSQL_SELECT_CLAUSE can be set when you have a database,
# which is structuraly different from proposed. The fixed string will
# be used to do a SELECT operation on database, which should return fields
# in order specified bellow:
#
# username, cryptpw, uid, gid, clearpw, home, maildir, quota, fullname
#
# Enabling this option causes ignorance of any other field-related
# options, excluding default domain.
#
# There are two variables, which you can use. Substitution will be made
# for them, so you can put entered username (local part) and domain name
# in the right place of your query. These variables are:
#	 	$(local_part) and $(domain)
#
# If a $(domain) is empty (not given by the remote user) the default domain
# name is used in its place.
#
# This example is a little bit modified adaptation of vmail-sql
# database scheme:
#
# MYSQL_SELECT_CLAUSE	SELECT popbox.local_part,			\
#			CONCAT('{MD5}', popbox.password_hash),		\
#			domain.uid,					\
#			domain.gid,					\
#			popbox.clearpw,					\
#			CONCAT(domain.path, '/', popbox.mbox_name),	\
#			'',						\
#			domain.quota,					\
#			'',						\
#			FROM popbox, domain				\
#			WHERE popbox.local_part = '$(local_part)'	\
#			AND popbox.domain_name = '$(domain)'		\
#			AND popbox.domain_name = domain.domain_name
#
##NAME: MYSQL_CHPASS_CLAUSE:0
#
# (EXPERIMENTAL)
# This is optional, MYSQL_CHPASS_CLAUSE can be set when you have a database,
# which is structuraly different from proposed. The fixed string will
# be used to do an UPDATE operation on database. In other words, it is
# used, when changing password.
#
# There are four variables, which you can use. Substitution will be made
# for them, so you can put entered username (local part) and domain name
# in the right place of your query. There variables are:
# 	$(local_part) , $(domain) , $(newpass) , $(newpass_crypt)
#
# If a $(domain) is empty (not given by the remote user) the default domain
# name is used in its place.
# $(newpass) contains plain password
# $(newpass_crypt) contains its crypted form
#
# MYSQL_CHPASS_CLAUSE	UPDATE	popbox					\
#			SET	clearpw='$(newpass)',			\
#				password_hash='$(newpass_crypt)'	\
#			WHERE	local_part='$(local_part)'		\
#			AND	domain_name='$(domain)'
#
