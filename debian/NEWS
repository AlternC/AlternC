alternc (0.9.9) stable; urgency=low

    Starting with 0.9.9, we do not overwrite Postfix's main.cf directly
    (#1029). However, some settings are directly overwritten, using
    postconf -e (as per Debian Policy). Those settings are configured in
    /etc/alternc/postfix.cf and are therefore managed as a configuration
    file which means that your configuration changes will be preserved.
    
    Also, this is the last release that will overwrite the main Bind
    configuration file (named.conf). All changes will be performed in
    named.conf.options in the future. This release still installs a new
    named.conf that will make sure that this transition functions
    properly. See #1025 and #1104.
    
    We also got rid of the bind_internal parameter. This configuration is
    not recommended as it allows recursive queries on an authoritative
    nameserver. The 'internal' ACL can still be changed in a template if
    required. Similarly, we now let the mynetworks configuration in
    Postfix up to the administrator and do not prompt for it directly
    through AlternC.

    We now support Apache2 out of the box, but it's not the default
    platform deployed. To install AlternC with Apache2, you will need a
    commandline like this:
    
        apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5 alternc
    
    Note, however, that this doesn't take care of removing the existing
    apache1 installation. This is a more complex operation that must be
    performed with a complete package manager like aptitude or synaptic.
